## A quick FAQ:

 

Q: How do I configure it?

A: go to your config folder and locate the files es_general.toml and es_stats.toml. If you are using 1.0.6 and up now you can set config in game through cloth config (1.0.8) and configured mod.

 

Q: Backport to X version?

A: Nope, exeptions might happen, but mostly nyo.



## Other versions of the mod will be added soon.
